<h2>Our Stock Picking Strategy</h2>
<hr />
<div>
    <p>
        When we are doing stock selection, we have a lot of values to see.
        In the assignment of our group, we chose to calculate the price-earnings ratio of
        each stock as our stock selection strategy. First, let us see what is the
        price-earnings ratio. PE ratio is the most commonly used indicator
        to assess whether a stock price level is reasonable. The price is
        divided by the stock price divided by the earnings per share.
        PE can also be seen as a return on investment, in units of time.
        For example, a company's stock price is 10 US dollars, and the annual
        profit is 2 US dollars. The price-earnings ratio is 5, which is equivalent to earning
        the principal in 5 years after you purchase the company's stock for 10 dollars.
        When we consider PE as a key factor in our stock picking strategy, we need to focus on
        whether the company's stock is profitable and whether the company's stock price really
        has high value. Because the high value of the company's stock is not reflected in the price
        of the stock, but reflected in the level of PE.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        So how do we use PE for stock selection? First of all, we must avoid choosing
        stocks with too high PE values, because this means that the time period for us
        to recover costs will be very long. Secondly, we can't choose PE stocks that are
        too low, because a company's PE is too low, indicating that the market is not
        good for the company, and the stock has limited room for growth. Moreover,
        low-PE stocks tend to be large-cap stocks, and the elasticity is very poor.
        A large percentage of capital purchases cannot afford to increase the percentage
        (such as financial stocks), which is suitable for avoiding risks and is not
        suitable for pursuing high returns.<br />If we use PE as a key indicator of the
        selection strategy, we should focus on the PE of other stocks in the same
        industry, whether the PE of the stock we want to buy has an advantage;
        moreover, we should also consider that the stock is in each historical period,
        whether the PE is stable.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Almost no one in the market does not pay attention to the price-to-earnings ratio
        of stocks. This kind of measurement is very simple and intuitive. If the
        P/E ratio indicator is used well, it will help investors to improve their
        profits. This is the advantage of using P/E as an important indicator of
        the stock picking strategy. However, P/E ratio also has shortcomings. For
        example, the price-earnings ratio is directly related to the income. The higher
        the income, the lower the price-earnings ratio, and the income of the
        enterprise is unstable. For companies with very stable performance, it
        is easy to use the current P/E ratio. For companies with unstable performance,
        the current P/E ratio is extremely unreliable. The current low P/E ratio does
        not necessarily mean underestimation. The high current P/E ratio does not
        necessarily mean overestimation.

    <h2>We developed two strategies based on PE</h2>
    <p>We filtered out 20 stocks that have lower PE Ratio at first. Then we measure the 
    risk of these 20 stocks from two aspects:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Company Financial status</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We picked out three indicators to evaluate each stocks: Operating Revenue,
                Total Asset, and Cash Flow.</li>
                <li>Operating Revenue is the account used to calculate the income generated by a
                company's main business, and its growth rate reflects the profitability of the
                company's main business.</li>
                <li>Total Asset refer to all assets owned or controlled by an economic entity
                that can bring economic benefits. The company with high Total Asset has the
                higher ability to resist risks.</li>
                <li>Free cash flow represents cash that the company is free to control, When the
                economy is in a downturn, companies with abundant cash flow have stronger
                ability to conduct mergers and acquisitions, and the anti-risk coefficient is
                also higher.</li>
                <li>The recommendations are high Operating Revenue, high Total Asset, and high Cash Flow
                companies' stocks.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The model takes into account the asset's sensitivity to non-diversifiable risk
                (also known as systematic risk or market risk), often represented by the
                quantity beta (β) in the financial industry, as well as the expected return
                of the market and the expected return of a theoretical risk-free asset.</li>

                <li>We use the daily price growth rate of a certain stock as the expected asset return,
                and corresponding daily price growth rate of S&P 500 as the expected market return.
                Then we did a regression analysis of these data for one year, where expected asset
                return is Y and expected market return is X. The resulting coefficient of X is the
                beta (β), which is the sensitivity of the expected excess asset returns to the
                expected excess market returns.</li>

                <li>Based on the CAPM, we bring in the yield of government bonds as a risk-free rate, 
                and then calculate the overvaluation or undervaluation of each stock price. The 
                recommendations are undervalued stocks.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
